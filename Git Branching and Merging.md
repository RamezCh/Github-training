# Git Branching and Merging

## Branch
A Basic approach followed in any version control system. Independent development line. Do the changes in branch and then merge it to master branch.
- Master is default branch which gets created at time of git initialization
- Most of development projects have two mainstream branches: Master (final source code), Dev (for development and testing purposes)
- HEAD or master branch points to the latest commit
